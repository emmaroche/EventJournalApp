# Event Journal App

Assignment for Mobile App Development MSc 2024

## App Overview

For my Mobile Application Development assignment I developed an “Event Journal” app. This app acts as a digital journal where users can document their events / experiences (e.g. birthdays, holidays, parties) to look back on.

I developed this app using Kotlin and Android Studio by combining practical lab content from class, self-learning, and independent research.

## App Functionality

- A splash screen that displays the apps custom logo before proceeding to the main content.
- User authentication functionality to allow users to register and log into their accounts via email and password OR via Google Authentication.
- Users can add, view, edit, and delete (single OR all) events.
- When adding an event, users can input various details including event names, types,  dates, times, descriptions, budgets/ event cost information, and images.
- Users can search for events by event name.
- Users have the option to favourite events.
- Users can toggle/filter between viewing all events, viewing only their favourite events
- and/or viewing only past events.
- Users have the option to update their profile picture to their own photo.
- Integrated maps functionality, enabling users to view their event locations via a
- Google Maps API.
- Maps can be filtered to show all events, favourited events and/or past events.

## GitHub workflow

The GitHub workflow used throughout the labs and assignment was:

_Branch - Commit(s) - Push - Pull Request - Merge - Delete Branch_
